## Hi, I am Ashlee Milton!

I am a Ph.D student with [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/) at the University of Minnesota, advised by [Dr. Stevie Chancellor](http://steviechancellor.com/). 

My research interests are focused in the areas of Social Computing, Information Retrieval, and Human-Computer Interaction. I also have a particular interest in working with stigmatized users and communities.
