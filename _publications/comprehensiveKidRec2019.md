Given how ingrained Search Engines (SEs) are in educational environments, it is essential to evaluate their performance in response to inquiries that pertain to the classroom setting. In this position paper, we discuss the limitations of relying solely on traditional Information Retrieval metrics and usability studies. We argue in favor of a new comprehensive strategy for assessment that integrates other aspects (i.e., the search context) with new and existing measures, in order to better quantify positive and negative factors that influence SEs outcomes targeting children.
